## Introduction

This repository includes machine learning models and projects that I developed during my internship at CodSoft. Each project is organized in its own directory with relevant code, data, and documentation.

## Projects

### Task 1: Movie Genre Prediction

- **Description**: Created a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.
- **Techniques Used**: TF-IDF
- **Classifiers**: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
- **Directory**: `Movie Genre Classification`
- **Dataset**: [Movie Genre Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb)

### Task 2: Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction Detection

- **Description**: Built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transaction information.
- **Techniques Used**: Decision Trees
- **Directory**: `Credit Card Fraud Detection`
- **Dataset**: [Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection)

### Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction

- **Description**: Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business using historical customer data, including usage behavior and demographics.
- **Techniques Used**: Gradient Boosting
- **Directory**: `customer-churn-prediction`
- **Dataset**: [Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction)

### Task 4: SMS Spam Classification

- **Description**: Built an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings with the Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Techniques Used**: TF-IDF
- **Classifiers**: Naive Bayes
- **Directory**: `sms-spam-classification`
- **Dataset**: [SMS Spam Dataset]([link-to-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset))
