## Introduction

This repository includes machine learning models and projects that I developed during my internship at CodSoft. Each project is organized in its own directory with relevant code, data, and documentation.

## Projects

### Task 1: Movie Genre Prediction

- **Description**: Created a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.
- **Techniques Used**: TF-IDF, word embeddings
- **Classifiers**: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
- **Directory**: `movie-genre-prediction`

### Task 2: Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction Detection

- **Description**: Built a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing transaction information.
- **Techniques Used**: Decision Trees
- **Directory**: `fraud-detection`
